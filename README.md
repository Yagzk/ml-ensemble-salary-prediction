# ml-ensemble-salary-prediction
The goal of this project is to build a regression model that predicts baseball player salary (Salary) using the Hitters dataset, and to compare the performance of different model families—especially Boosting-based models (Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost), which are the main focus of the assignment.
